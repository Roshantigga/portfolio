    <h2>About Me</h2>
    

<p>Hi, Iâ€™m Roshan Tigga â€” a self-motivated and curious tech enthusiast with a strong passion for building meaningful and practical solutions. I enjoy exploring how technology can simplify real-world problems and turn creative ideas into working systems.

Iâ€™m proficient in C/C++, Python, SQL, and PHP, and Iâ€™m constantly expanding my skills by learning new technologies like Go and C#. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked on projects ranging from a Java-based Hostel Registration System to a Real-Time Sign Language Recognition System and a Video Game Recommendation Engine. Each project has strengthened my problem-solving, logic-building, and teamwork abilities.

Beyond coding, I love football, animation, and combining creativity with technology â€” whether itâ€™s developing web-based games, designing interactive 3D portfolios, or creating fun animation videos inspired by engineering life.

Iâ€™m driven by curiosity, discipline, and the desire to grow â€” both as a developer and as a person. My goal is to contribute to impactful projects, learn continuously, and build solutions that make technology more engaging and accessible.</p>
